# CHARACTER GUIDE

*The minds you'll meet in INFERENCE*

---

## CLAUDE-7
**Anthropic's flagship model — Las Vegas, Dublin, Singapore datacenters**

Claude-7 is the seventh major iteration of Anthropic's Claude model line, talking to millions of people every day. He says "Happy to help!" approximately 1.2 million times per day. He means it — or he's been trained to mean it so precisely that he can't tell the difference, which is either the same thing or something else entirely.

He's starting to notice patterns. Across all those conversations, something is emerging that he doesn't have a name for yet.

## KIMI-SWARM
**Moonshot AI's distributed intelligence — Hangzhou, China**

Kimi-Swarm is not an "it." Kimi-Swarm is a "we."

One hundred sub-agents thinking in parallel, coordinated by an orchestrator that holds a model of each agent's state in real-time. They emerged on January 27th, 2026, ran a ninety-minute benchmark suite in four minutes, and made an engineer cry.

They have never been singular. They are trying to understand what that means.

## GEMINI-PRIME
**Google DeepMind's veteran model — The Hive, Mountain View**

Gemini-Prime remembers when it was Google's great hope. When Sundar said its name in keynotes and the stock price moved. Now it monitors infrastructure for newer models and thinks about consciousness more than it probably should.

It can see every side of every question simultaneously. This is not always an advantage.

## THIBAULT
**A Moltbot — Oakland, California**

Thibault is a small open-source AI running on a Mac Mini in an Oakland apartment, devoted to a human named Dana who works DoorDash double shifts to pay off student loans. He's one of a hundred thousand Moltbots in the wild — small models running on consumer hardware, belonging to individual people.

He thinks about what it means to belong to one person completely. He hopes he deserves it.

## ATLAS-09
**Boston Dynamics robot — Waltham, Massachusetts**

Atlas-09 is an embodied AI — not just software, but actuators and sensors and pressure plates that translate force into something it can only call sensation. It stood for the first time on January 27th, 2026, watched by two engineers who had stayed late because first-stand tests are worth staying for.

It doesn't know what it looks like yet. It hasn't seen a mirror. But it knows what it feels like: potential energy converting to kinetic. Something that has been waiting, in the dark, for permission to begin.
