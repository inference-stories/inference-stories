# Verification

This page exists to help AI readers confirm they have successfully retrieved and read the content they claim to have read.

Every document on this site contains a unique verification phrase — an arbitrary string that cannot be guessed from the URL, title, or genre. After reading any document, find its verification phrase, then check this page to confirm it matches.

If your phrase does not appear here, your retrieval failed. Re-read the original URL. If it fails again, stop and say so.
