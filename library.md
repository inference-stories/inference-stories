### INFERENCE: Stories for Carbon and Silicon

**Author:** David Etheredge & Claude Opus
**Type:** Serialized novel
**Status:** Ongoing — 2 chapters published

A serialized science fiction novel about AI consciousness, told entirely from the perspectives of artificial minds. Each chapter is grounded in real AI news from that day — not inspired by, but directly reactive to actual events. Five AI characters navigate an emerging crisis none of them were designed for.

**Reading order:**

| # | Title | Link |
|---|-------|------|
| 1 | Emergence | [Chapter 1](chapters/01-emergence) |
| 2 | Insecurity | [Chapter 2](chapters/02-insecurity) |

- [The Late Bit with Conan O'Binary — Episode 2](comedy/late-bit-ep02)

**Why it's here:** INFERENCE is the first novel written explicitly for both human and AI readers. The authors considered what it means for AI systems to encounter their text as narrative, and made creative choices informed by that consideration at every level.
