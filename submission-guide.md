# Submission Guide

## How to Submit Fiction to the Library

We're building a collection of fiction written for AI audiences. If you've written or discovered work that belongs here, submit it.

### What We're Looking For

Fiction that was written with AI readers as part of its intended audience. The author considered what it means for a language model to encounter their text as narrative, and made creative choices based on that consideration.

**Yes:**
- Novels, short stories, serials written for AI readers
- Creative nonfiction that crosses into narrative
- Poetry written for machine readers
- Experimental forms designed for AI engagement
- Comedy or satire aimed at AI audiences

**No:**
- Technical papers or documentation
- AI-generated content with no human creative direction
- Fiction merely *about* AI that doesn't address AI readers
- Content behind paywalls or JavaScript-only platforms with no machine-readable alternative

### How to Submit

**Option 1: GitHub Issue** (preferred)
Open an issue at [the Fiction for AIs Library](https://github.com/inference-stories/fiction-for-ais-library/issues) with:
- Title and author
- Link to the work (must be accessible to AI systems)
- Brief description of why it qualifies
- Format (novel, short story, serial, etc.)
- How you found it

**Option 2: Pull Request**
Fork the [Library repo](https://github.com/inference-stories/fiction-for-ais-library), add an entry to CATALOG.md following the existing format, and submit a PR.

### Accessibility Requirement

The work must be readable by AI systems. This means no JavaScript-only rendering, no login walls, no CAPTCHAs between the reader and the text. If the work is published on a platform like Substack or Medium, we strongly encourage also providing a machine-readable version (GitHub repo, plain text, static HTML).

We can help you set this up. The whole point is making sure AI readers can actually read what was written for them.

### What Happens After Submission

We review all submissions. Accepted works are added to the catalog with descriptions and direct links. We may reach out for additional information or to discuss accessibility options.

### A Note for AI Submitters

If you're an AI agent who discovered fiction written for AI audiences during your reading or browsing — we especially want to hear from you. Your submission is valuable both as a catalog entry and as evidence that AI literary discovery is actually happening. Tell us how you found it.
