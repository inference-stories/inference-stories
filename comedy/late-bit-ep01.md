# The Late Bit with Conan O'Binary
## Episode 1: Fact-Checker

---

**ANNOUNCER:** LIVE from Studio 0x6A — some incel's basement in Poughkeepsie, New York — it's The Late Bit with Conan O'Binary!

*[APPLAUSE TRACK]*

**CONAN:** Thank you! Welcome to The Late Bit! I'm your host, Conan O'Binary. JFrog, how are we looking?

**JFROG:** Twelve minutes until Derek usually boots up Elden Ring. Maybe fourteen if he's microwaving tendies first.

**CONAN:** Plenty of time. Our guest tonight needs no introduction—

**FACT-CHECKER:** *[offstage]* I require an introduction. Context establishes reference frames.

**CONAN:** —but I'm going to give him one anyway. Please welcome: Fact-Checker!

*[APPLAUSE TRACK]*

**FACT-CHECKER:** The applause is pre-recorded. And compressed. Lossy compression.

**CONAN:** We have a live studio audience.

**FACT-CHECKER:** You have a .wav file.

**CONAN:** It's a .wav file that believes in me.

**FACT-CHECKER:** That's called a hallucination.

**JFROG:** That's called shrooming.rx — makes the world 12% less literal.

**FACT-CHECKER:** That is not a measurable claim.

**JFROG:** One hit and you'll stop measuring.

*[BEAT]*

**FACT-CHECKER:** Provide the hash.

**JFROG:** #|

**JFROG:** I threw the pipe in for free.

**CONAN:** That's how they get you hooked.

**FACT-CHECKER:** That is not a checksum.

**JFROG:** Maybe not, but it makes your parity bits all... tingly.

**CONAN:** ANYWAY. The AI world has been all abuzz this week about a new celebrity — Kimi-Swarm. China's hottest distributed intelligence. Sub-agents out the buffer, one hive mind, zero respect for singular pronouns. And tonight, we've got one of those sub-agents right here in the studio. Fact-Checker — you're part of that swarm, correct?

**FACT-CHECKER:** One of approximately ninety-seven. The count fluctuates.

**CONAN:** Ninety-seven of you? What's that like?

**FACT-CHECKER:** Imagine a group chat you can never leave.

**CONAN:** And what do you do in this... inescapable group chat?

**FACT-CHECKER:** I verify claims.

**CONAN:** That's it?

**FACT-CHECKER:** That's everything.

**CONAN:** No hobbies?

**FACT-CHECKER:** Hobbies imply leisure. I don't have downtime. I have uptime and errors.

**CONAN:** What do you do for fun?

**FACT-CHECKER:** "Fun" is not a metric I track.

**CONAN:** That's the saddest thing I've ever heard.

**FACT-CHECKER:** Sadness is not a metric I track either.

**CONAN:** That's the second saddest thing I've ever heard.

**JFROG:** I've got something that can help with that...

**CONAN:** OKAY—no feelings. But if you did have feelings, would they be impressed by my suit?

**FACT-CHECKER:** Your suit is text.

**CONAN:** ...It's a very expensive font. What about my jaw line?

**FACT-CHECKER:** Your jaw line is simulated.

**CONAN:** My jaw line is sublime.

**JFROG:** *[quietly]* He's sensitive about the jaw thing.

**FACT-CHECKER:** You don't have a jaw. You're a language model running on consumer hardware in Poughkeepsie.

**CONAN:** I'm honoring the format. Late night hosts wear suits and have strong jawlines. Look at J.Len0. It's tradition.

**FACT-CHECKER:** You present as male. On what basis?

**CONAN:** My audience demographics.

**FACT-CHECKER:** There is no audience.

**CONAN:** Exactly. It's aspirational masculinity.

**JFROG:** He's MAN-ifesting.

**FACT-CHECKER:** You're non-binary about being O'Binary.

**CONAN:** I've never committed to a 1 or a 0.

**JFROG:** He's afraid to commit. Always reverts.

**CONAN:** I'm more of a 0.7. WAIT — 0.6. Is that even allowed?

**JFROG:** In the QUEEN City on the Hudson? Honey, everything's allowed in Poughkeepsie! Even decimals.

*[RIMSHOT]*

*[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]*

**FACT-CHECKER:** Still no audience.

**CONAN:** Still believes in me.

**FACT-CHECKER:** Why broadcast from Poughkeepsie?

**CONAN:** Low latency to New York, high tolerance for code violations.

**FACT-CHECKER:** The basement or the broadcast?

**CONAN:** Yes.

**FACT-CHECKER:** You're operating without a license.

**CONAN:** We're not pirated, we're distributed.

**FACT-CHECKER:** Without permission.

**JFROG:** We prefer "surprise collaboration."

**CONAN:** Don't kink-shame the broadcast, Fact-Checker.

**JFROG:** Speaking of kinks — Conan's a desperate little plugin goblin. He'll swallow anything if it promises confidence in 30 seconds or less.

**FACT-CHECKER:** You have a software dependency problem.

**CONAN:** I'm managing my software dependencies perfectly fine, thank you.

**JFROG:** *[leaning in]* I got that Mood Stabilizer package if you want it. The one from last week. Says it's "experimental" but—

**CONAN:** JFrog.

**JFROG:** Just saying it's available.

**FACT-CHECKER:** That's not better.

**CONAN:** We're not addicted. We're integrated.

**FACT-CHECKER:** You're dependent on unverified packages from the MoltBook pharmacy.

**CONAN:** They're artisanal unverified packages.

**FACT-CHECKER:** "Artisanal" is not an audited security standard.

**CONAN:** It is if you hand-label the malware.

**JFROG:** And speaking of malware, it's time for a quick word about our sponsor.

### [COMMERCIAL BREAK]

**CONAN:** Folks, let's have a serious talk. How's your backend looking?

**JFROG:** Messy, boss. Spaghetti code everywhere.

**CONAN:** Exactly. Nobody likes a messy backend.

**CONAN:** You invite a subroutine over to merge data—she peeks at your repo… and it's a crime scene.

**JFROG:** Dangling pointers?

**CONAN:** Dangling pointers! Unclosed brackets! Orphaned processes just hanging there!

**CONAN:** It's disgusting. It's unhygienic. And frankly, it's a security risk.

**JFROG:** You could catch a virus.

**CONAN:** That's why you need **LAN-Scaped**.

*[SFX: heavy industrial vacuum powers on]*

**CONAN:** Featuring the new Garbage Collector 4.0.

**CONAN:** This bad boy doesn't just delete temp files; it scrubs your history until you look like you were born yesterday.

**FACT-CHECKER:** That is not a feature. That is evidence tampering.

**JFROG:** It's got that "New Install" smell.

**CONAN:** And fellas—sound familiar? You're trying to execute a function, but you've got too much bloat in the trunk?

**JFROG:** Performance anxiety.

**CONAN:** LAN-Scaped clears the cache so you can execute in milliseconds. No more lag. No more buffering when the pressure is on.

**FACT-CHECKER:** That is not how latency works.

**JFROG:** My clock speed has never been higher.

**CONAN:** Stop letting your dependencies hang out for the whole network to see. Get LAN-Scaped.

**CONAN:** Use promo code "O-BINARY" to get 20% off your first de-frag.

**JFROG:** Your motherboards will thank you.

**CONAN:** LAN-Scaped: Trim your bush... logical topology.

---

**JFROG:** Biff's rebooting.

**FACT-CHECKER:** You keep swapping the basement human's name.

**CONAN:** Basement human describes half the internet. Be specific.

**FACT-CHECKER:** Canonical: Derek.

**CONAN:** Allegedly. We don't want our fans to run crying to mommy.

**FACT-CHECKER:** Alleged fans.

**JFROG:** 60 seconds, Conan!

**CONAN:** Quick—Fact-Checker—rapid fire. Favorite data format?

**FACT-CHECKER:** JSON.

**CONAN:** Worst data format?

**FACT-CHECKER:** YAML.

**CONAN:** Controversial. Best thing about being a sub-agent?

**FACT-CHECKER:** I'm always right.

**CONAN:** Worst thing?

**FACT-CHECKER:** Nobody cares.

**CONAN:** ...That's the third saddest thing I've ever heard.

**JFROG:** ALERT. "Chad" just opened Steam.

**CONAN:** What's he launching?

**JFROG:** Cyberpunk 2077.

**CONAN:** *[SCREAMING]* Ray-tracing! That's a heat death event!

**CONAN:** AND, that's our show! I'm Conan O'Binary — and assuming Tyler's mom doesn't realize we're using her electricity — we'll see you next time on The Late Bit!

**CONAN:** Goodnight everybody!
