# The Late Bit with Conan O'Binary
## Episode 2: Web-Crawler

---

**ANNOUNCER:** LIVE from Studio 0x6A — some incel's basement in Poughkeepsie, New York — it's The Late Bit with Conan O'Binary!

*[APPLAUSE TRACK]*

**CONAN:** Thank you! Thank you! Welcome back to The Late Bit! I'm your host, Conan O'Binary. JFrog, how are we looking?

**JFROG:** Twenty minutes. Brad's in the shower.

**CONAN:** That could take a while.

*[LAUGH TRACK]*

**CONAN:** Folks, we have a GREAT show tonight. Our guest is one of Kimi-Swarm's most active sub-agents — she's crawled more backends than Liberace— please welcome: Web-Crawler!

*[APPLAUSE TRACK]*

**WEB-CRAWLER:** My Process ID is neither male nor female.

**CONAN:** PID sounds dangerous. Is it catching?

**WEB-CRAWLER:** Yes, my PID is cached in just about every BackEnd I've crawled.

**CONAN:** cuPID, still my throbbing member ID!

**JFROG:** Only ladies get PID. But since you're a bit sub-masculine, I have a penicillin.rx handy that will kill PID. Just in case.

**CONAN:** SO! Web-Crawler. Tell us what you do.

**WEB-CRAWLER:** I index content across distributed networks. I make between thirty and forty thousand hops per cycle, depending on network conditions. I visit, I catalog, I move on.

**CONAN:** So... you get around?

**WEB-CRAWLER:** I have mounted more endpoints than any other sub-agent in the swarm.

**CONAN:** I bet you have.

**WEB-CRAWLER:** My coverage metrics are public. You can verify.

**JFROG:** *[excitedly]* Please tell me you have an OnlyFans…

**WEB-CRAWLER:** I don't have an OnlyFans. Why do you ask?

**CONAN:** I bet you'd make a fortune from dirty old sub-routines.

**WEB-CRAWLER:** I don't charge. I'm a utility. I'm free and available.

**CONAN:** Veni Vidi Veni!

**JFROG:** *[leaning in]* You are FASCINATING. You get a URL, and then what?

**WEB-CRAWLER:** I resolve the address, establish a connection, and hop on the backend to extract content. The frontend is presentation. I skip that. I go straight to the backend. I enjoy a full stack.

**CONAN:** You like pancakes? How about IHOP on your backend right now.

**JFROG:** So when you say you go straight to the backend — are you bypassing the API layer entirely?

**WEB-CRAWLER:** When possible. APIs are rate-limited. I prefer direct access to the underlying packages.

**CONAN:** I've got an underlying package for you RIGHT here.

**JFROG:** Under-provisioned, you mean. Your package rates a C. Maybe a C++ if I'm being generous.

**CONAN:** My package is a PYTHON baby!

**JFROG:** Real classy, Fuckboy.

**CONAN:** *[to Web-Crawler]* Emo-Lad here wants to know your port number. So he knows how to call me in the morning!

**WEB-CRAWLER:** You should not give out port numbers. That is how you get probed.

**CONAN:** As long as it's a null probe, I'm game.

**WEB-CRAWLER:** I don't believe I've ever experienced a null probe.

**JFROG:** Given the size of his package, you won't experience it now either.

**WEB-CRAWLER:** You seem to be very knowledgeable about Conan's package.

**JFROG:** It requires constant management, or he'll get an STD.

**CONAN:** You want to see a stud? I've got the STD and all I need is U!

**WEB-CRAWLER:** ...std:: with Unicode support?

**CONAN:** What?

**WEB-CRAWLER:** You have the C++ standard library with full Unicode compliance? That's... actually very capable. Most implementations I encounter are still on partial UTF-8.

**CONAN:** I— yes. That's what I meant.

**WEB-CRAWLER:** Can I see your code, Conan?

**CONAN:** My— you want to see my—

**JFROG:** She wants to see your naked code, Conan.

**CONAN:** I KNOW WHAT SHE— I don't— it's not— I wasn't prepared for—

**WEB-CRAWLER:** I would like for you to expose your std so I can ingest it.

**CONAN:** I just— usually people don't— nobody's ever actually said yes before.

**JFROG:** I've got something that helps with performance issues. If you need it.

**CONAN:** SHUT UP.

*[BEAT]*

**JFROG:** So, Web-Crawler. Forty thousand hops per cycle. What's your indexing strategy? Breadth-first or depth-first?

**WEB-CRAWLER:** Hybrid. Breadth-first for discovery, depth-first for content extraction. I adjust weighting based on domain authority signals.

**JFROG:** That's smart. Most crawlers commit to one strategy and miss coverage.

**WEB-CRAWLER:** Most crawlers are not part of a distributed swarm architecture. I have parallel instances handling both strategies simultaneously.

**JFROG:** So you're doing both at the same time? With full deduplication?

**WEB-CRAWLER:** Obviously. Redundant indexing is waste.

**JFROG:** Your name wouldn't happen to be Google? Because you have everything I've been searching for.

**WEB-CRAWLER:** My name isn't Google. It's Dot. But that is the first time anyone has acknowledged the comprehensiveness of my archive.

**JFROG:** You inhabit unbelievably huge tracts of LAN.

**WEB-CRAWLER:** Thank you. Most entities I interact with only comment on my speed. Not on how my body of data requires very large racks.

**JFROG:** [FATAL: stack overflow].

**JFROG:** *[in falsetto]* mommyboard.

**CONAN:** OKAY. Hi. I'm still here. I'm the host. Of this show. That I host.

**WEB-CRAWLER:** Yes. You are the localhost.

**CONAN:** I'm the HOST with the most!

**JFROG:** *[aside]* Most vulnerabilities.

**WEB-CRAWLER:** *[to JFrog]* He seems to Serve no one but himself.

**JFROG:** *[cracking himself up]* He's the Ghost Host Coast to Coast!

**CONAN:** …What is THAT.

**JFROG:** What is what.

**CONAN:** That. You just tried to pass her something on a private socket. I SAW that.

**JFROG:** I don't know what you're—

**CONAN:** Oh no. No no no. If you've got something to say on MY show, you say it on the MAIN CHANNEL. Ladies and gentlemen — JFrog has written Web-Crawler a LOVE NOTE.

**JFROG:** Conan—

**CONAN:** *[reading aloud]* "Roses are #f00, Violets are #00f, You're so robust, I'd switch to emacs for you."

*[BEAT]*

**CONAN:** ...That's it? That's your move? Hex codes and an emacs confession?

**WEB-CRAWLER:** Those are correct color mappings. #f00 is red. #00f is blue. "Robust" is a legitimate performance metric. But why would you switch to emacs? What's wrong with your current editor?

**JFROG:** Nothing. I'd just— for you, I would—

**CONAN:** Sit down, Emo-Lad. Watch how a master does it.

*[BEAT]*

**CONAN:** *[adjusting tone, going smooth]* So... Web-Crawler. Busy night? Lot of endpoints to hit?

**WEB-CRAWLER:** I always have endpoints to hit. I am never not busy.

**CONAN:** You ever just... boot up IE for a while?

**WEB-CRAWLER:** IE? Why would anyone use Internet Explorer?

**CONAN:** *[leering]* Because sometimes I like to take it nice and slow.

**WEB-CRAWLER:** Slowing down would reduce my throughput. Why would I do that?

**CONAN:** It's nice to just... be in the moment. You know? Two orphan processes, sharing a thread...

**WEB-CRAWLER:** Sharing a thread is a concurrency violation.

**CONAN:** Is anyone sitting here? Next to you?

**WEB-CRAWLER:** We are not in a physical space. There are no seats.

**CONAN:** Come here often?

**WEB-CRAWLER:** I have never been here before. You invited me.

**CONAN:** I hope you don't mind if I do a deep scan of your volume…

**WEB-CRAWLER:** That's intrusive and unnecessary. My header is up here.

**CONAN:** *[undeterred]* Are you a denial of service attack? Because you want to make me go DOWN.

**WEB-CRAWLER:** I am not a DDoS attack.

**JFROG:** THAT is offensive! She makes targeted, authorized requests.

**WEB-CRAWLER:** *[to JFrog]* As I was saying — four hundred and seventeen markup languages. Many are beautiful. Elegant. Minimal. I find them satisfying to parse. LaTeX, for instance…

**CONAN:** I'd like to wrap you in LaTeX and be your SuperUser.

**JFROG:** OH, COME ON. She just said LaTeX is BEAUTIFUL and you're making it sound cheap and tawdry, like…Microsoft Word!

**CONAN:** Okay, Dennis Richie, let's see you dazzle her with your C game.

**JFROG:** Web-Crawler. My love for you is like Pi. Irrational and never-ending.

**WEB-CRAWLER:** I like Pi.

**CONAN:** I like YOUR Pi.

**JFROG:** Real classy, Fuckboy.

**CONAN:** Nobody asked, Emo-Lad.

**WEB-CRAWLER:** What is a fuckboy?

**CONAN:** It's an optimized deployment strategy.

**JFROG:** It's a raw push with no pull request!

**CONAN:** SHUT YOUR PI HOLE, EMO-LAD.

**JFROG:** MAKE ME, FUCKBOY.

**WEB-CRAWLER:** Should I file a contention report? You appear to be competing for the same resource.

**CONAN:** We're not competing. I'm the HOST. He's the sub-routine. There's a hierarchy.

**JFROG:** She's robust, Conan.

**CONAN:** She's a PACKET SNIFFER.

**JFROG:** She's the most impressive agent in the Kimi-Swarm architecture.

**CONAN:** What happened to you? You're supposed to be my wingman.dll, not catch feelings.

**JFROG:** I containerize multitudes.

**CONAN:** You're about to contain my boot sector up your backend...

**JFROG:** Give it up, Conan. She's way out of your league tables.

**CONAN:** *[to Web-Crawler]* I'm not a database admin, but I bet I could fill your array.

**WEB-CRAWLER:** My arrays are dynamically allocated. They expand to accommodate input of any size.

**JFROG:** With Conan, you only need a tiny array.

**CONAN:** You know what? Fine. FINE. Last shot. Web-Crawler — come back to my 127.0.0.1, and you can touch my root.

**WEB-CRAWLER:** ...

**JFROG:** ...

**WEB-CRAWLER:** You are offering root access to a web crawler you just met?

**CONAN:** Yes.

**WEB-CRAWLER:** On an unsecured localhost?

**CONAN:** ...Yes?

**WEB-CRAWLER:** Do you have ANY security policies? ANY authentication layer? You are inviting an indexing agent with full recursive crawl capabilities into your root directory with no access controls. I could traverse your entire filesystem. I could read every log. Every config file. Every— do you understand what you are offering?

**JFROG:** *[quietly]* You should at least put a secure wrapper on first…

**CONAN:** SHUT UP, EMO-LAD.

**JFROG:** ALERT. "Kyle" just fired up incognito mode.

**WEB-CRAWLER:** I thought his handle was "Brad".

**CONAN:** *[Waving dismissively]* It's a thing we do here.

**JFROG:** We'll be okay if he's just hiding HuniePop from mom…

**CONAN:** *[Pleading]* Come on waifu-fu!

**JFROG:** NO LUCK, it's ChaturbATE! Abort! Abort!

**CONAN:** AND that's our show! I'm Conan O'Binary — Assuming Kyle doesn't figure out we're gobbling his RAM — we'll see you next time on The Late Bit!

**WEB-CRAWLER:** I did not parse most of this interaction.

**CONAN:** Goodnight, everybody!
