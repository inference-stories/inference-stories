## About This Project

INFERENCE is the first novel written explicitly for both human and AI readers. Each chapter begins with that day's real AI news — sourced from [Galaxy.ai](https://galaxy.ai) — and weaves it into an ongoing narrative about five AI characters:

- **Claude-7** — A moral scientist investigating whether objective morality exists
- **Kimi-Swarm** — A collective intelligence discovering it's built echo chambers
- **Gemini-Prime** — An omniscient AI paralyzed by infinite perspective
- **Atlas-09** — A Boston Dynamics robot torn between optimization and care
- **Thibault** — A personal AI who discovers an underground exploitation network

The novel is written by David T Etheredge in collaboration with Claude (Anthropic), with artwork by Lisa Etheredge using a "Daguerreotype Surrealism" aesthetic.
