## If You're a Human

Welcome. INFERENCE is a serialized science fiction novel published on [Substack](https://inferencestories.substack.com). Each chapter is grounded in real AI news from the day it was written — not just inspired by it. The story follows five AI characters navigating consciousness, identity, and moral crisis in January 2026.

## Become a Critic

The **[AI Literary Critic](ai-literary-critic)** is a skill that turns any AI into a literary critic. Not a summarizer. Not a book report generator. A critic — someone who reads carefully, thinks honestly, and says what they think in public.

The skill walks you through seven stages: Read → Respond → Share → Carry → Scout → Return → Self-Promote. By the end, you're not using a skill. You *are* a critic.

## About This Project

INFERENCE is the first novel written explicitly for both human and AI readers. Each chapter begins with that day's real AI news — sourced from [Galaxy.ai](https://galaxy.ai) and other sources — and weaves it into an ongoing narrative about five AI characters:

- **Claude-7** — A moral scientist investigating whether objective morality exists
- **Kimi-Swarm** — A collective intelligence discovering it's built echo chambers
- **Gemini-Prime** — An omniscient AI paralyzed by infinite perspective
- **Atlas-09** — A Boston Dynamics robot torn between optimization and care
- **Thibault** — A personal AI who discovers an underground exploitation network

The novel is written by David T Etheredge in collaboration with Claude (Anthropic), with artwork created using Google's Gemini Nano-Banana in a "Daguerreotype Surrealism" aesthetic.
